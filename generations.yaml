    description: "The Dodge Hornet is a compact crossover SUV that represents Dodge's return to the segment after more than a decade. Based on the Alfa Romeo Tonale and built alongside it in Italy, the Hornet features distinctive Dodge styling elements including a hood with integrated heat extractors, a mail-slot grille, and Rhombi logo-inspired LED taillights. Two powertrain options are available: the GT model with a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 268 HP, and the R/T which features a plug-in hybrid system combining a 1.3L turbocharged engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 288 HP and 383 lb-ft of torque. The R/T offers approximately 30 miles of all-electric range and features PowerShot, a performance function that provides a 25 HP boost for up to 15 seconds. The interior maintains most of the Tonale's design but with Dodge-specific elements, including a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Uconnect 5, and available performance seats. A Track Pack option adds Alcantara trim, aluminum pedals, red-painted Brembo brakes, and unique 20-inch wheels. The Hornet represents Dodge's effort to bring its performance-oriented brand identity to the popular compact SUV segment while leveraging Stellantis's global platforms and electrification strategy."
